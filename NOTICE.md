## Why These Restrictions?

This project is both:
- A **scientific research effort** (open for academic use and peer review).
- The **foundation for a commercial software product** (design and implementation private until release).

By keeping commercial rights reserved, we can:
- Encourage open research and collaboration.
- Prevent unapproved commercial exploitation before the official release.
